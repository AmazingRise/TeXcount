TeXcount documentation
======================

There are documentation at different levels of detail and technicality:

* **QuickReference** gives a quick overview of options and TeXcount instructions which may be used to control how TeXcount processes TeX documents.

* **TeXcount** is the main documentation giving a detailed explanation of how TeXcount processes TeX documents, and how to use options and TeXcount instructions to customise the word counting and reporting the results.

* **TechDoc** is the technical documentation of the internals of TeXcount.

Other .tex documents (macro.tex, sub_*.tex) are supplementary files to be included in the main documents.
